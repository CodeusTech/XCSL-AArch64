# Executable Bytecode

XCS provides a system for storing and recalling user applications as binary strings, known as **Bytecode**.

Bytecode works in two stages: First, they *build* the binary string, then they can later *run* it as a program.

### Build Bytecode

**Build** is a keyword that accepts a valid XCSL expression and returns an executable binary string.

### Run Bytecode

**Run** is a keyword that accepts a valid XCS binary string and executes it as a user application.
